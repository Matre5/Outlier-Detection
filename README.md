# 🗳️ Outlier Detection using Election Result

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing election results using data science techniques to detect outliers. 
It explores patterns in voting data, visualizes key trends, and provides insights into the electoral process. 
The analysis includes voter turnout, party performance, regional trends, and outlier detection using geospatial techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data manipulation and analysis)
- **Pandas** (for handling and processing data)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Geopandas & Folium** (for geospatial analysis)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive coding)

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and formats the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and insights.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Maps election results across different regions.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies anomalies in voting patterns.
